## Description

The Eye Movement Exercise is a game consisting in creating a pair of eyes that would follow the direction of the cursor. For this exercise, a starter code was provided allowing us to determine how the game would work with one eye. Adding the second eye and make it follow the direction of the cursor was the real challenge of this exercise.

## Future work

* Create a button that gives you the option of turning on and off the lights. When the light is on, you would be able to see in the background a normal house scenery. When the lights are off, you would be able to see the pair of eyes following the cursor.
* Create a second button that gives you the possibility of creating more eyes when the lights are off.
